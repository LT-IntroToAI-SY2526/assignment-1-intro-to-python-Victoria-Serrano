# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
My initial experience with Python was way different comparing to programming languages I've used previously. In Python, I have to create codes and use the tech of AI to help write and create my own functions, which I haven't previosuly done before.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI effectively to help me generate practice problems. Not only did I use AI to create practice problems for me, I also used AI to help me create codes and to correcly guide me to creating the write code such as inputs, outputs, code words.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** Using AI to generate practice problems for me to complete was the toughest part. I had to learn how to create multiple codes that work and make sure that the functions had no issues.


4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
While collarborating with AI, I found it best to ask questions that provided AI lots of information rather than just asking for the answers. The more information that was given to AI, the better and more specific the responses were from AI.
